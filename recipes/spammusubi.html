        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of Spam</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked sushi rice</li>
            <li>4 sheets nori (seaweed)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>Optional: Furikake seasoning for garnish</li>
            <li>Optional: 2 Eggs</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the sushi rice according to package instructions. Once cooked, let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, sugar, and rice vinegar until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice the Spam into 8-10 even slices.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the Spam slices and cook until they are browned and crispy on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Once the Spam is cooked, pour the soy sauce mixture over the slices in the skillet. Let it simmer for a minute or two until the sauce thickens and coats the Spam. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>To assemble the musubi, place a sheet of nori on a clean surface. Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, then take about 1/2 cup of cooked rice and shape it into a rectangle that fits the width of the nori sheet.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of the cooked Spam on top of the rice.</li>
            <li>If desired, sprinkle some furikake seasoning over the rice for added flavor.</li>
            <li>Fold the nori sheet over the rice and Spam, wrapping it tightly. You can use a little water to seal the edge of the nori.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process for the remaining Spam slices and rice.</li>
            <li>Optional: If you want to add eggs, you can make a thin omelette with the beaten eggs, cook it in a skillet, and then slice it into strips to add on top of the Spam before wrapping with nori.</li>
            <li>Slice each musubi in half if desired, and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious Spam Musubi!</li>
        </ol>
